# Plague Delight

<img src="src/main/resources/plaguedelight_logo.png" width="50%">

Plague Delight is an addon mod for Farmer's Delight based around disease and
medicine!

By interacting with mobs, players, and the environment, the user has a chance
to catch one of several diseases. With some determination and a little luck,
users can culture pathogens and create a variety of medicines and vaccines to
stay healthy.

Plague Delight is still in the pre-release stage, so I plan to add way more
functionality! Stay tuned. Please report any bugs or features you would like
added.
